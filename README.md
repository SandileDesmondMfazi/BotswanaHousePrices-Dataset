# GaboroneHousePricePredicitions
The python scripts developed during the 16-Days Challenge: Personal House Price Prediction Project - Beginner

## Overview
I have decided to start a 16-Day House Price Prediction Personal Project Challenge, it’s a challenge I’m part taking in in order to encourage myself to start and finish the project, and also I’m posting it so that viewers like you can hold me accountable if I don't live up to the challenge. 
In this challenge, I will collect data, create a House Prices Dataset, and test my regression skills by designing an algorithm to accurately predict house prices in Gaborone, Botswana. Accurately predicting house prices can be a daunting task. The buyers are just not concerned about the size(square feet) of the house and there are various other factors that play a key role to decide the price of a house/property. It can be extremely difficult to figure out the right set of attributes that are contributing to understanding the buyer's behavior. So the dataset that I will create will consist of data across various property aggregators across Gaborone, Botswana. In this challenge, my role as a data scientist is to predict the prices as accurately as possible.
Also, after this challenge, I will create a lot of room for improvement, learn more about feature engineering, and master advanced regression techniques such as Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, and various other ensembling techniques.
